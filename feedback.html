<h1>Feedback</h1>

<p>I (<a href="https://github.com/jstuyts">Johan Stuyts</a>) have tried to ensure that all information in this manual is
  correct. However, I am not a system administrator nor a security specialist, so mistakes and oversights are possible.
</p>

<p>If you find an error or you think that some parts are not clear enough, please <a
      href="https://github.com/jstuyts/Secure-WinRM-Manual/issues">report an issue</a>. I will try to fix the problems
  as soon as possible. </p>
