<h1>Server Configuration</h1>

<div class="windows-server">
  <h2>Enabling WinRM With Default Configuration</h2>

  <p>To keep things simple, we will start with the <a
        href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384372(v=vs.85).aspx">default configuration of WinRM</a>. This
    enables some insecure connection methods, but these will be disabled immediately:</p>

  <div class="lock-container">
    <div class="lock-powershell"></div>
    <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-wqc')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
          id="sc-wqc">winrm quickconfig</span></span></pre>
  </div>

  <h2>Disabling HTTP Connections</h2>

  <div class="important-for-security">
    <div>
      <p>It is very important that you know you are connecting to the correct server. If the client does not verify the
        server, you could send commands to the remote server that might disclose sensitive information.</p>

      <p>This step will ensure that your server's identity can be verified, but note that servers not under your control
        may still enable connection methods that prevent the client from verifying that server. So always double-check
        that you <strong>use the correct connection method on the client</strong>. The chapter about Windows client
        configuration explains how to force the use of HTTPS.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The server is now listening for HTTP connections on port 5985. Clients cannot verify the server identity when using
    HTTP, so the HTTP connection method has to be disables:</p>

  <div class="lock-container">
    <div class="lock-powershell"></div>
    <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-wdhl')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
          id="sc-wdhl">winrm delete winrm/Config/Listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP</span></span></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The firewall rules for the HTTP connection method can also be removed. There are rules for modern and
    backward-compatible configurations, and all of them will be deleted.</p>

  <p>The name of the backward-compatible rule(s) is language-dependent. The second command can be used to find out the
    actual name of these rules.</p>

  <div class="lock-container">
    <div class="lock-powershell"></div>
    <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-fdmr')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
          id="sc-fdmr">netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name='Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)'</span></span></pre>
  </div>

  <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-flbcr')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
        id="sc-flbcr">netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all | Select-String 'Windows Remote Management'</span></span></pre>

  <div class="lock-container">
    <div class="lock-powershell"></div>
    <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-fdbcr')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
          id="sc-fdbcr">netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name='Windows Remote Management - <span
          class="configuration-dependent-value">&lt;language-dependent name&gt;</span> (HTTP-In)'</span></span></pre>
  </div>

  <h2>Setting the Allowed Authentication Methods</h2>

  <div class="important-for-security">
    <div>
      <p>Clients should be able to connect to a server without having to send the user's credentials. And the attack
        surface of a server should be minimized. So only a minimal and secure set of authentication methods should be
        enabled.</p>

      <p>This step will ensure that your server is properly configured, but servers not under your control may still
        allow insecure authentication methods. So always double-check that you <strong>use the correct authentication
          method on the client</strong>. In the chapter about Windows client configuration, the authentication methods
        that the WinRM client may use are limited.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This step is to make sure that only the desired authentication methods are enabled. The insecure ones should be
    disabled by default. Certificate authentication is disabled by default too, so it needs to be enabled.</p>

  <p>To inspect the current settings run this command:</p>

  <div class="lock-container">
    <div class="lock-powershell"></div>
    <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-wgsac')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
          id="sc-wgsac">winrm get winrm/Config/Service/Auth</span></span></pre>
  </div>

  <!-- TODO: Is "negotiate" really needed? -->
  <p>To allow clients to authenticate using certificates only the negotiate and certificate authentication methods have
    to be enabled. Whether other authentication methods need to be enabled depends on your environment. For example:
    Kerberos authentication is used in environments with Active Directory Domain Services, so it is very likely that it
    must be enabled in such environments.</p>

  <p>The only one that must never be enabled is basic authentication, because this will send your password to the
    server. Credential security support provider (CredSSP) authentication must only be enabled if there is no other
    option available, as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb931352(v=vs.85).aspx">it
      will send your credentials to the server</a>.</p>

  <p>Enable the negotiate and certificate authentication methods. Adjust this to your situation as needed: Match the
    methods with the ones available in your environment, and enable methods besides negotiate and certificate if
    needed:</p>

  <div class="lock-container">
    <div class="lock-powershell"></div>
    <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-wssac')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
          id="sc-wssac">winrm set winrm/Config/Service/Auth '@{Basic="false";Kerberos="false";Negotiate="true";Certificate="true";CredSSP="false"}'</span></span></pre>
  </div>

  <h2>Checking the Network Category</h2>

  <div class="important-for-security">
    <div>
      <p>This step changes the network category of your network connection(s) (if needed). In most cases Windows will
        have determined the correct network cateogry, but there are some situations (working with virtual machines, for
        example) where Windows chooses the incorrect network category.</p>

      <p><strong>Never change the network category from public to private if you are not actually on a private
        network.</strong> Windows will expose a lot more services on a private network, greatly increasing your attack
        surface. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>WinRM will not allow connections from public networks. In most cases the network connection(s) will be private or
    domain-authenticated, but in some cases Windows erroneously chooses public. Check the category of the network where
    your clients are located using the following command:</p>

  <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-gncp')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
        id="sc-gncp">Get-NetConnectionProfile</span></span></pre>

  <p>If the network category needs to be changed from public to private, run the following command:</p>

  <div class="lock-container">
    <div class="lock-powershell"></div>
    <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-sncp')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
          id="sc-sncp">Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceIndex <span class="configuration-dependent-value">&lt;interface index&gt;</span> -NetworkCategory Private</span></span></pre>
  </div>

  <h2>Create the Server Certificate</h2>

  <div class="important-for-security">
    <div>
      <p>A script that is not a part of Windows is used in this step. <strong>Never blindly trust scripts you
        download.</strong> Either make sure that the source can really be trusted, or inspect the script to ensure that
        it will not harm your system before using it.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Windows includes a cmdlet with which you can create self-signed certificates, but unfortunately certificates that
    can be used for WinRM authentication cannot be generated. Luckily there is a <a
          href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Self-signed-certificate-5920a7c6">PowerShell script
      available that can generate usable certificates</a>.</p>

  <p>The (9/11/2016 version of the) <a href="downloads/New-SelfSignedCertificateEx.ps1">script is also included in this
    manual</a> so you can download it directly using, for example, <code class="command">wget</code> or <code
        class="command">Invoke-WebRequest</code>. The site above presents a <a
        href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/cc300389.aspx">license agreement</a> which prevents direct downloads.
  </p>

  <p>Check that the script has not been modified by checking its signature. The second command shows more detailed
    information about how the script is signed:</p>

  <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-gas-1')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
        id="sc-gas-1">Get-AuthenticodeSignature New-SelfSignedCertificateEx.ps1</span></span>
<span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-gas-2')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span id="sc-gas-2">Get-AuthenticodeSignature New-SelfSignedCertificateEx.ps1 | Format-List *</span></span></pre>

  <p>Make sure that you verify the certificate subject (CN=Sysadmins LV IK, O=Sysadmins LV IK, L=Riga, C=LV) and
    thumbprint (<code class="thumbprint">1A8EAB5B0611AC0548F16A1675B8A3915CC2045E</code>) before actually running the
    script on the server.</p>

  <p>First import the function in the script file, and then create the certificate for the server using the function.
    The common name (CN) of the subject needs to match the name that you will use to connect to the server later. If you
    want to use the simple hostname, you can use <code class="command">$env:COMPUTERNAME</code>. The documentation of
    the script says that friendly names can be used to specify the enhanced key usage, but this does not seem to work
    everywhere. So the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg699362.aspx#Anchor_0">OID for server
      authentication</a> is used here instead:</p>

  <div class="lock-container">
    <div class="lock-powershell"></div>
    <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-csc-1')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
          id="sc-csc-1">. .\New-SelfSignedCertificateEx.ps1</span></span>
<span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-csc-2')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span id="sc-csc-2">$serverCert = New-SelfSignedCertificateEx -Subject "CN=<span
            class="configuration-dependent-value">&lt;(fully-qualified) hostname&gt;</span>" -EnhancedKeyUsage '1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1' -StoreLocation LocalMachine -IsCA $true</span></span></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The certificate has been added to <code class="command">Cert:\LocalMachine\My\</code> and <code class="command">Cert:\LocalMachine\CA\</code>,
    using the thumbprint as the child name. </p>

  <p>The thumbprint is going to be needed to verify whether the correct public key has been downloaded by clients, so
    display it and copy it somewhere:</p>

  <div class="lock-container">
    <div class="lock-powershell"></div>
    <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-sc')"
          class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span id="sc-sc">$serverCert</span></span></pre>
  </div>

  <h2>Enabling a Secure WinRM Listener</h2>

  <p>The final step for the Windows server is the addition of a secure WinRM listener. This is done in two steps:
    creation of the listener and opening of the firewall for it.</p>

  <p>Execute the following command to create the listener. The hostname must match the hostname used when creating the
    server certificate:</p>

  <div class="lock-container">
    <div class="lock-powershell"></div>
    <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-cswl')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
          id="sc-cswl">winrm create winrm/Config/Listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS "@{Hostname=`"<span
          class="configuration-dependent-value">&lt;(fully-qualified) hostname&gt;</span>`";CertificateThumbprint=`"$($serverCert.ThumbPrint)`"}"</span></span></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Next open the firewall for the port (5986). The port is only opened on domain and private networks. If you want
    WinRM to be available on public networks too, omit <span class="command">profile='domain,private'</span>:</p>

  <div class="lock-container">
    <div class="lock-powershell"></div>
    <pre class="powershell"><span onclick="selectTextOfElement('sc-cswlfr')" class="copy-to-clipboard">PS &gt; <span
          id="sc-cswlfr">netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name='WinRM-HTTPS' dir=in localport=5986 protocol=TCP profile='domain,private' action=allow</span></span></pre>
  </div>
  
  <p>And that is it for the server configuration. We will return to the server when a local administrator for client
    connections has to be created. But that is part of the client configuration chapters.</p>
